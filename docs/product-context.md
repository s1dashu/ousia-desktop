# Product Context

This branch is the simplified Ousia desktop client. The product focus is a
direct agent chat experience with projects, sessions, and settings.

The app is intentionally not extension-native on this branch. Runtime
extensions, first-party workspace extensions, extension tabs, and agent-operable
extension actions have been removed.

## Scope

In scope:

- Project and session navigation in the left sidebar.
- Agent chat backed by pi coding agent in Electron main.
- Project/session isolated cwd for agent work.
- User settings for appearance mode, Radix color scale, model provider API
  keys, model, thinking level, and default chat directory.

Out of scope:

- Ousia runtime extensions under `~/.ousia/extensions`.
- First-party Browser, Editor, PDF, Excalidraw, or Sheets workspace surfaces.
- Built-in right-side terminal or other secondary workspace panels.
- Workspace extension tabs or extension picker.
- Local `ousia extension ...` CLI bridge.
- Ousia extension usage skill injection into pi sessions.

## Product Boundary

The agent is the primary worker. File preview, editing, browser, terminal, and
custom UI workflows should happen through normal agent tools or future explicit
product work, not through the removed extension system or a secondary workspace
panel.

## Glossary

- Sidebar: left project/session/settings navigation.
- Chat: central conversation surface for the pi coding agent.
- Default chat directory: directory used by unassigned sessions, currently
  `~/.ousia/chat`.
